1.	Beer Dominates the Market : 
Beer accounts for 62.83% of total revenue, outperforming other categories like wine and liquor by a wide margin.
2.	Significant Monthly Variations in Sales : 
Sales dropped to a low in February 2019 (401,117) and peaked in August 2020 (595,340). These shifts may be influenced by seasonal events or promotional campaigns.
3.	Top Suppliers Are Key to Revenue : 
A small number of suppliers, including Crown Imports and Miller Brewing Company, drive most of the sales volume, indicating supplier dependency.
4.	Preference for 12OZ Packaging : 
The most sold items (e.g., Corona Extra 12OZ, Heineken 12OZ) suggest a strong consumer preference for smaller, single-serve packaging.


## Recommendations
1.	Maximize Focus on Beer Segment : 
Develop promotions, bundles, and campaigns centered on beer to drive growth in the leading category.
2.	Align Operations with Seasonal Sales Trends : 
Prepare for expected low/high sales months by adjusting stock, promotions, and staffing accordingly.
3.	Strengthen Strategic Supplier Relations : 
Create preferred supplier programs or negotiate better terms with top contributors to ensure product availability and reduce risk.
4.	Expand Small-Pack Offerings : 
Increase SKU diversity in the 12OZ segment and test new packaging options that align with consumer demand patterns.
